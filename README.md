# animatch

Early stage.

**animatch** is intended to search and match a whole lot of video files and add either a specific AniDB tag like `[a123456]` or rename all of those files to their proper file names in a Plex appropriate manner.

My current use case is to prepare a bunch of files for FileBot and in the long run maybe to replace FileBot, even tho it is a great tool.

The go templating engine is powerful enough to replace a lot of the functionality that is provided by Groovy used in FileBot.
